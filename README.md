<!-- Landing Page

A hero section with a background that feels like a lush forest or enchanted castle, with soft, glowing lights, mist, and floating elements like fireflies or magical particles. The colors should be pastel and soft, with hues like lavender, pale pink, mint green, and golden yellows, giving the page a dreamlike, ethereal quality. The headline should be in a delicate, cursive font that looks like it’s made from enchanted vines or fairy lights. The call-to-action button should be designed like a glowing crystal or gemstone, with a soft glow effect, labeled 'Discover My Work.'

A project showcase section with cards that resemble old parchment or scrolls, with subtle flourishes and details like lace, stars, or whimsical floral borders. The project titles should be in an elegant serif font with a soft, handwritten touch. Hover effects could include a soft sparkle or glow, like magic emanating from the card, or the card gently floating as if it's carried by the wind.

A contact form section with input fields that resemble scrolls or magical runes, with delicate lines or tiny floral details. The labels should have an ethereal font, with a faint glowing effect, and the submit button should look like a fairy’s wand, glowing and sparkling when hovered over.

Add a footer with social media links designed as mystical icons (e.g., Instagram as a glowing orb, LinkedIn as a vine-wrapped crystal). The icons should have a magical, otherworldly glow, and hover effects could include a soft twinkling effect or an ethereal pulse.

The overall color palette should be soft and pastel, with light purples, pinks, and greens, and subtle touches of gold, silver, and white, to evoke a sense of fantasy, magic, and whimsy. The design should feel enchanting, creating a dreamy, fairytale-like atmosphere that invites users into a magical world. -->
